# Tennis Serve Evaluation

This repository provides the code needed to compare a tennis serve to a reference.

## Implementation Details

All material is for academic use only. Not for commercial use. Some of the images/videos are from public sources.

Implementation is done on Linux.

Outside of a virtual environment, clone the Pr-VIPE Github repository and install openpifpaf and DTW for Python. 
Split the videos into image sequences and move them into the folders called img and fed_img (own and reference). Move those folders under POEM in the folder created during the Github clone.
Move scripts into the same location and run to create embeddings for both.
